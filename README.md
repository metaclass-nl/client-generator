# API Platform Client Generator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/api-platform/client-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/api-platform/client-generator)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40api-platform%2Fclient-generator.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40api-platform%2Fclient-generator)

API Platform Client Generator is a generator to scaffold app with Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete features for any API exposing a [Hydra](http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/) or [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) documentation for:
 * React/Redux
 * React Native
 * Vue.js

Works especially well with APIs built with the [API Platform](https://api-platform.com) framework.

## Adapted version

This branch holds an adapted version of React Generator
based on the [Api Platform Tutorial chapter 4 react branch](https://github.com/metaclass-nl/api-platform-tutorial/tree/chapter4-react).
It scaffolds an Internationalized and Localized application that uses [React Intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/)
and shows entity names/labels instead of @ids and a Select widget for for a single reference.
It also generates the necessary common components, utils and message files.

Be aware that the code scaffolded by these templates needs data from
the api to contain label properties to be typed as http://schema.org/name
and labels of referred entities to be included (possible by serialization groups). 
Because the generator only has access to the metadata of the single type for which it is scaffolding,
it assumes all referred types label properties have the same name. If this assumption is wrong
you need to correct the scaffolded code. See 
[the tutorial chapter 4 api branche](https://github.com/metaclass-nl/api-platform-tutorial/tree/chapter4-api) 
for an example on how to create the required annotations. 

Finally, if your application needs the user to edit references to multiple
entities, the scaffolded entryfield will only be usable if you show the @ids
of the entities somewhere in the application, for example in the List component.

See the readme of [the tutorial chapter 3 react branche](https://github.com/metaclass-nl/api-platform-tutorial/tree/chapter3-react) 
for how to adapt your client/src/index.js 
for React Intl and an example of how to adapt client/src/messages/all.js. 

## Documentation

The documentation of API Platform's Client Generator can be browsed [on the official website](https://api-platform.com/docs/client-generator).

## Usage

**Hydra**
```sh
npx @api-platform/client-generator https://demo.api-platform.com/ output/ --resource Book
```

**OpenAPI v2 (formerly known as Swagger)** (experimental)
```sh
npx @api-platform/client-generator https://demo.api-platform.com/docs.json output/ --resource Book --format swagger
```

or

```sh
npx @api-platform/client-generator https://demo.api-platform.com/docs.json output/ --resource Book --format openapi2
```

**OpenAPI v3** (experimental)
```sh
npx @api-platform/client-generator https://demo.api-platform.com/docs.json?spec_version=3 output/ --resource Book --format openapi3
```

## Features

* Generate high-quality ES6 components and files built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org), [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) and [Redux Form](http://redux-form.com/) including:
  * A list view
  * A creation form
  * An editing form
  * A deletion button
* Use the Hydra or Swagger API documentation to generate the code
* Generate the suitable HTML5 input type (`number`, `date`...) according to the type of the API property
* Display of the server-side validation errors under the related input (if using API Platform Core)
* Client-side validation (`required` attributes)
* The generated HTML is compatible with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and includes mandatory classes
* The generated HTML code is accessible to people with disabilities ([ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) support)
* The Redux and the React Router configuration is also generated
